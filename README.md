# Exam Randomizer Script
## Description
This script uses Google's AppScript functionality to transform a Google sheet into a properly formatted and randomized student exam. It reads all questions in the format prompt/answer/choice1/choice2/etc. It starts reading at column B, row 8, turning each row into a question object which will then be written into the output google doc.
